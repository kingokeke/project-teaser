# Project Teaser

This is a primer before the main group project for Squad 002 at Decagon Institute, Lagos, Nigeria.
In this project teaser, we will:

Create API for a product management system, where:

- A user can signup.
- A user can signin.
- A user can update his profile details.
- A user can delete his account.
- A user create a product.
- A user can view all his products.
- A user can view all the products in the platform.
- A user can only update his product.
- A user can delete only his product.

The tools to be employed in this project teaser include:

- MySQL
- SQL
- Sequelize
- NodeJS
- Git
- GitHub
- Postman

NOTE: To practice writing both in raw SQL and Sequelize, the create and update queries will be written in pure SQL while the read and delete queries will be written in Sequelize.
